Little has been written on managing your own research (and very little
on avoiding other people managing your research); however, your
research is much more under your control than you may realize.

We are concerned with great research here. Work that will get wide
recognition, perhaps even wine Nobel Prize. As most people realize,
the average published paper is read by the author, the referee, and
perhaps one other person. Classic papers are read by thousands. We are
concerned with research that will matter in the long run and become
more than a footnote in history.

If you are to do important work then you must work on the right
problem at the right time and in the right way. Without any one of the
three, you may do good work but you will almost certainly miss real
greatness.

Greatness is a matter of style. For example, after learning the
elements of painting, you study under a master. While studying you pay
attention to what the master says in discussing your work, but you
know that if you are to achieve greatness then you must find your own
style. Furthermore, a successful style in one age is not necessarily
appropriate for another age. Cubism would not have gone over big
during the realism period.

Similarly, there is no simple formula for doing great science or
engineering, I can only talk around the topic. The topic is important
because, so far as we have any solid evidence, you have but one life
to live. Under these circumstances it seems better to live a life in
which you do important things (important in your eyes, of course) than
to merely live out your life. No sense frittering away your life on
things that will not even appear in the footnotes.

### Choosing the problem 

I begin with the choice of problem. Most scientists spend almost all
of their time working on problems that even they admit are neither
great or are likely to lead to great work; hence, almost surely, they
will not do important work. Note that importance of the results of a
solution does not make the problem important. In all the 30 years I
spent at Bell Telephone Laboratories (before it was broken up) no one
to my knowledge worked on time travel, teleportation, or
anti-gravity. Why? Because they had no attack on the problem. Thus an
important aspect of any problem is that you have a good attack, a good
starting place, some reasonable idea of how to begin.

To illustrate, consider my experience at BTL. For the first few years
I ate lunch with the mathematicians. I soon found that they were more
interested in fun and games than in serious work, so I shifted to
eating with the physics table. There I stayed for a number of years
until the Nobel Prize, promotions, and offers from other companies,
removed most of the interesting people. So I shifted to the
corresponding chemistry table where I had a friend.

At first I asked what were the important problems in chemistry, then
what important problems they were working on, or problems that might
lead to important results. One day I asked, "if what they were working
on was not important, and was not likely to lead to important things,
they why were they working on them?" After that I had to eat with the
engineers!

About four months later, my friend stopped me in the hall and remarked
that my question had bothered him. He had spent the summer thinking
about the important problems in his area, and while had had not
changed his research he thought it was well worth the effort. I
thanked him and kept walking. A few weeks later I noticed that he was
made head of the department. Many years later he became a member of
the National Academy of Engineering. The one person who could hear the
question went on to do important things and all the others -- so far
as I know -- did not do anything worth public attention.

There are many right problems, but very few people search carefully
for them. Rather they simply drift along doing what comes to them,
following the easiest path to tomorrow. Great scientists all spend a
lot of time and effort in examining the important problems in their
field. Many have a list of 10 to 20 problems that might be important
if they had a decent attack. As a result, when they notice something
new that they had not known but seems to be relevant, then they are
prepared to turn to the corresponding problem, work on it, and get
there first.

Some people work with their doors open in clear view of those who pass
by, while others carefully protect themselves from
interruptions. Those with the door open get less work done each day,
but those with their door closed tend not know what to work on, nor
are they apt to hear the clues to the missing piece to one of their
"list" problems. I cannot prove that the open door produces the open
mind, or the other way around. I only can observe the correlation. I
suspect that each reinforces the other, that an open door will more
likely lead you and important problems than will a closed door.

Hard work is a trait that most great scientists have. Edison said that
genius was 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration. Newton said that if
others would work as hard as he did then they would get similar
results. Hard work is necessary but it is not sufficient. Most people
do not work as hard as they easily could. However, many who do work
hard -- work on the wrong problem, at the wrong time, in the wrong
way, and have very little to show for it.

You are aware that frequently more than one person starts working on
the same problem at about the same time. In biology, both Darwin and
Wallace had the idea of evolution at about the same time. In the area
of special relativity, many people besides Einstein were working on
it, including Poincare. However, Einstein worked on the idea in the
right way.

The first person to produce definitive results generally gets all the
credit. Those who come in second are soon forgotten. Thus working on
the problem at the right time is essential. Einstein tried to find a
unified theory, spent most of his later life on it, and died in a
hospital still working on it with no significant results. Apparently,
he attacked the problem too early, or perhaps it was the wrong
problem.

There are a pair of errors that are often made when working on what
you think is the right problem at the right time. One is to give up
too soon, and the other is to persist and never get any results. The
second is quite common. Obviously, if you start on a wrong problem and
refuse to give up, you are automatically condemned to waste the rest
of your life (see Einstein above). Knowing when you persist is not
easy -- if you are wrong then you are stubborn; but if you turn out to
be right, then you are strong willed.

I now turn to the major excuse given for not working on important
problems. People are always claiming that success is a matter of luck,
but as Pasteur pointed out, "Luck favors the prepared mind."

A great deal of direct experience, vicarious experience through
questioning others, and reading extensively, convinces me of the truth
of his statement. Outstanding successes are too often done by the same
people for it be a matter of random chance.

For example, when I first met Feynman at Los Alamos during the WWII,
I believed that he would get a Nobel Prize. His energy, his style, his
abilities, all indicated that he was a person who would do many
things, and probably at least one would be important.  Einstein,
around the age of 12 or 14, asked himself what a light wave would look
like if he want at the speed of light. He knew that Maxwell's theory
did not support a local, stationary maximum, but was what he ought to
see if the current theory was correct. So it is not surprising that he
later developed the special theory of relativity - he had prepared his
mind for it long before.

Many times a discussion with a person who has just done something
important will produce a description of how they were led, almost step
by step, to the result. It is usually based on things they had done,
or intensely thought about, years ago. You succeed because you have
prepared yourself with the necessary background long ago, without, of
course, knowing then that it would prove to be a necessary step to
success.

### Personal traits 

There traits are not all essential, but tend to be present in most
doers of great things in science. First, successful people exhibit
more activity, more energy, than most people do. They look more
places, they work harder, they think longer than less successful
people. Knowledge and ability are much like compound interest -- the
more you do the more you can do, and the more the opportunities are
open for you. Thus, among other things, it was Feynman's energy and
his constantly trying new things that made one think he would succeed.

This trait must be coupled with emotional commitment. Perhaps the
ablest mathematician I have watched up close seldom, if ever, seemed
to care deeply about the problem he was working on. He has done great
deal of first class work, but not of the highest quality. Deep
emotional commitment seems to be necessary for success. The reason is
obvious. The emotional commitment keeps you thinking about the problem
morning, noon and night, and that tends to beat out mere ability.

While I was at Los Alamos after the war, I got to thinking about the
famous Buffon needle problem where you can calculate the probability
of a needle tossed at random of crossing one of a series of equally
spaced parallel lines. I asked myself if it was essential that the
needle be a straight line segment (if I counted multiple crossing)? 
No. Need the parallel lines be straight? No. Need they be equally
spaced or is it only the average density of the lines on the plane? Is
it surprising that some years later at Bell Labs when I was asked by
some metallurgists how to measure the amount of grain boundary on some
micro photographs I simply said, "Count the crossings of a random line
of fixed length on the picture?" I was led to it by the previous,
careful thought about an interesting, and I thought important, result
in probability. The result is not great, but illustrates the
mechanisms of preparation and emotional involvement.

The above story also illustrates what I call the "extra mile." I did
more than the minimum, I looked deeper into the nature of the
problem. This constant effort to understand more than the surface
feature of a situation obviously prepares you to see new
and slightly different applications of your knowledge. You cannot do
many problems such as the above needle problem before you stumble on
an important application.

Courage is another attribute of those who do great things. Shannon is
a good example. For some time he would come to work at about 10:00am,
play chess until about 2:00pm and go home.  The important point is how
he played chess. When attacked he seldom, if ever, defended his
position, rather he attacked back.  Such a method of playing soon
produces a very interrelated board. He would then pause a bit, think
and advance his queen saying, "I ain't afraid of nothing." It took me
a while to realize that of course that is why he was able to prove the
existence of good coding methods. Who but Shannon would think to
average over all random codes and expect to find that the average was
close to ideal? I learned from him to say the same to myself when
stuck, and on some occasions his approach enabled me to get
significant results.

Without courage you are unlikely to attack important problems with any
persistence, and hence not likely to do important things. Courage
brings self-confidence, an essential feature of doing difficult
things. However, it can border on over-confidence at time which is
more of a hindrance than a help.

There is another trait that took me many years to notice, and that is
the ability to tolerate ambiguity. Most people want to believe what
they learn is the truth: there are a few people who doubt
everything. If you believe too much then you are not likely to find
the essentially new view that transforms a field, and if you doubt too
much you will not be able to do much at all. It is a fine balance
between believing what you learn and at the same time doubting
things. Great steps forward usually involve a change of viewpoint to
outside the standard ones in the field.

While you are leaning things you need to think about them and examine
them from many sides. By connecting them in many ways with what you
already know.... you can later retrieve them in unusual situations. It
took me a long time to realize that each time I learned something I
should put "hooks" on it. This is another face of the extra effort,
the studying more deeply, the going the extra mile, that seems to be
characteristic of great scientists.

The evidence is overwhelming that steps that transform a field often
come from outsiders. In archaeology, carbon dating came from
physics. The first airplane was built by the Wright brothers who were
bicycle experts.

Thus, as an expert in your field, you face a difficult problem. There
is, apparently, an ocean of kooks with their crazy ideas; however, if
there is a great step forward it probably will be made by one of them! 
If you listen too much to them then you will not get any of your own
work done, but if you ignore them then you may miss your great
chance. I have no simple answer except do not dismiss the outsider too
abruptly as is generally done by in the insiders.

"Brains"" are nice to have, but often the top graduate students do not
contribute as much as some lower rated ones. Brains come in all kinds
of flavors. Experimental physicists do not think the same way as
theoreticians do. Some experimentalists seem to think with their
hands, i.e., playing with equipment lets them think more clearly. It
took me a few years to realize that people who did not know a lot of
mathematics still could contribute. Just because they could not solve
a quadratic equation immediately in their head did not mean I should
ignore them. When someone's flavor of brains does not match yours may
be more reason for paying attention to them.

### Vision 

You need a vision of who you are and where your field is going. A
suitable parable is that of the drunken sailor. He staggers one way
and then the other with independent, random steps. In n steps he will
be, on the average, about 3n steps away from where he started. but if
there is a pretty girl in one direction he will get a distance
proportional to n.  The difference, over a life time of choices,
between 3n and n is very large and represents the difference between
having no vision and having a vision. The particular vision you have
is less important than just having one - there are many paths to
success. Therefore, it is wise to have a vision of what you may
become, of where you want to go, as well as how to get there. No
vision, not much chance of doing great work; with a vision you have a
good chance.

Another topic I must discuss is that of age. Historically, the
greatest contributions of mathematicians, theoretical physicists, and
astrophysicists are done when they are very young. On the other hand,
apparently in music composition, politics, and literature, the later
works are most valued by society. Other areas seem to fall in between
these extremes, and you need to realize that in some areas you had
better get going promptly.

People often complain about the working conditions they have to put up
with, but it is easily observed that some of the greatest work was
done under unfavorable conditions. What most people believe is the
best working conditions for them is seldom, if ever, true. In my
opinion the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton has ruined more
good people than it has helped. You have only to judge their work
before they were appointed and afterwards to come to this
conclusion. There are exceptions, to be sure, but on the average the
supposed ideal working conditions seem to sterilize people.

Another obvious trait of great people is that they do their work in
such a fashion that others can build on top of it.  Newton said, "If I
had seen farther than others it is because I stood on the shoulders of
giants." Too many people seem to not want others to build on top of
their work but rather they want to hoard it to themselves. Don't do
things in such a fashion that next time it must be repeated by you, or
by others, but rather in a fashion that represents a significant step
forward.

### Selling 

I must now take up the unpleasant topic of selling your ideas. Too
many scientists think that this is beneath them, that the world is
waiting for their great results. In truth, the other researchers are
busy with their own work. You must present your results so that they
will stop their own work and listen to you. Presentation comes in
three forms: published papers, prepared talks, and impromptu
situations. You must master all three forms.

Lots of good work has been lost because of poor presentation only to
be rediscovered later by others. There is a real danger that you will
not get credit for what you have done. I know of all too many times
when the discoverer could not be bothered to present things clearly,
and hence his or her work was of no importance to society.

Finally, I must at least address the question of whether greatness is
worth the large effort it requires. Those who have done really great
things generally report, privately, that it is better than wine, the
opposite sex, and song put together.  The realization that you have
done it is overwhelming.

Of course I have consulted only those who did do great things, and
have no dared to ask those who did not. Perhaps they would reply
differently. But, as is often said, it is in the struggle and not the
success that the real gain appears. In striving to do great things,
you change yourself into a better person, so they claim. The actual
success is of less importance, so they say. And I tend to believe this
theory.

No one ever told me the kinds of things I have just related to you; I
had to find them out for myself. Since I have now told you how to
succeed, you have no excuse for not trying and doing great work in
your chosen field.
